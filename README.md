This branch provides a batched inference implementation of HAT (Hierarchical Autoregressive Transformer). This fork integrates HAT into vLLM v1 so you can run or serve HAT models with the same low-latency engine you know from vLLM. HAT wraps a standard Llama-style word-level transformer (referred to as the backbone) with two small byte-level modules: an encoder and a decoder.  For a comprehensive architectural and training deep-dive, including a closer look at each component discussed below, an accompanying research paper will soon be released; which will also provide more information on the challenges behind batched inference for such a model.

The encoder processes the input text as raw UTF-8 bytes, and produces a sequence of activations of the same length. The splitter is then in charge of splitting this text into words or semantically meaningful chunks. In the encoder connector layer, for each word, a learned latent vector attends to the encoder activations of the bytes which compose the word. The backbone then processes this word-level sequence to produce a sequence of word-level representations which guide the decoding process. Thus, to generate bytes auto-regressively, the decoder uses the encoder activations of the current word and the word-level representation of the previous word. 

Next Steps:
- Currently, our CUDA graph implementation for HAT is still based on the vLLM v0 approach. When [PR 20059](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm/pull/20059) gets merged, we will update our implementation and perform an upstream MR to vLLM.

# Environment Setup

### 1. Prerequisites
* **GPU**: NVIDIA GPU
* **Python**: 3.12. 
### 2. Clone and install
```bash
git clone <this-repository> vllm-hat
cd vllm-hat

# Create and activate a 3.12 virtual env
uv venv -p 3.12
source .venv/bin/activate

# Tell vLLM to skip local compilation and use prebuilt CUDA wheels
export VLLM_USE_PRECOMPILED=1

# Finally, install in editable mode
uv pip install -e .
```

---
---
# Using HAT

Points to keep in mind
- If you want to test out the 70B model, please make sure to specify tensor parallel size. If testing on GPUs with 80GB VRAM, we recommend setting tensor parallel size to 4.
- Currently, HAT only works with Flash Attention 2. Thus, if testing this model on Hopper architecture or newer, please make sure to export the environment variable `VLLM_FLASH_ATTN_VERSION = 2`.
- Additionally, running the 70B on H100 or newer currently does not work.

The supported HAT models are the following:
- `Aleph-Alpha/llama-3_1-8b-tfree-hat-dpo`
- `Aleph-Alpha/llama-3_1-8b-tfree-hat-sft`
- `Aleph-Alpha/llama-3_1-8b-tfree-hat-base`
- `Aleph-Alpha/llama-3_1-70b-tfree-hat-sft`
---
## Offline Inference 

We have included an example script to run offline inference. 

```bash
python hat_scripts/hat_offline_inference.py [OPTIONS]
```

**Optional Parameters:**
- `--model` - Path to the HAT model (default: Aleph-Alpha/llama-3_1-8b-tfree-hat-dpo)
- `--batch-size` - Batch size for inference (default: 16)
- `--max-bytes-per-req` - Output bytes (default: 1000)
- `--tensor-parallel-size` - Tensor parallelism size (default: 1)

---
## Serving Scenario (OpenAI-compatible API)

### Starting the server

```bash
vllm serve [MODEL] [OPTIONS]
```

**Example:**
```bash
vllm serve "Aleph-Alpha/llama-3_1-8b-tfree-hat-dpo" \
  --trust-remote-code \
  --dtype bfloat16 \
  --compilation-config '{"full_cuda_graph": true, "level": 0}'
  --max-num-batched-tokens 100000 \
  --tensor-parallel-size 1 \
  --gpu-memory-utilization 0.9 \
```

**Required Options:**
- `--trust-remote-code` - Required for HAT models
- `--dtype bfloat16` - Required data type for HAT models
- `--compilation-config '{"full_cuda_graph": true, "level": 0}'` - Required compilation settings for HAT models

**Optional Parameters:**
- `--max-num-batched-tokens` - Maximum number of batched tokens (default: varies)
- `--tensor-parallel-size` - Tensor parallelism size (default: 1)
- `--gpu-memory-utilization` - GPU memory utilization fraction (default: 0.9)

### Sending requests

Any OpenAI-compatible client works (curl, python, etc.). For convenience, we include a script that asynchronously sends multiple requests to the server:

```bash
python hat_scripts/send_async_prompts.py [OPTIONS]
```

**Optional Parameters:**
- `--api-url` - URL of the OpenAI-compatible chat completions API endpoint (default: http://localhost:8000/v1/chat/completions)
- `--num-concurrent-requests` - Number of concurrent requests to send (default: 16)
- `--max-bytes-per-req` - Output bytes (default: 1000)

## About

vLLM is a fast and easy-to-use library for LLM inference and serving.

Originally developed in the [Sky Computing Lab](https://sky.cs.berkeley.edu) at UC Berkeley, vLLM has evolved into a community-driven project with contributions from both academia and industry.

vLLM is fast with:

- State-of-the-art serving throughput
- Efficient management of attention key and value memory with [**PagedAttention**](https://blog.vllm.ai/2023/06/20/vllm.html)
- Continuous batching of incoming requests
- Fast model execution with CUDA/HIP graph
- Quantizations: [GPTQ](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.17323), [AWQ](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.00978), [AutoRound](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.05516), INT4, INT8, and FP8
- Optimized CUDA kernels, including integration with FlashAttention and FlashInfer
- Speculative decoding
- Chunked prefill

**Performance benchmark**: We include a performance benchmark at the end of [our blog post](https://blog.vllm.ai/2024/09/05/perf-update.html). It compares the performance of vLLM against other LLM serving engines ([TensorRT-LLM](https://github.com/NVIDIA/TensorRT-LLM), [SGLang](https://github.com/sgl-project/sglang) and [LMDeploy](https://github.com/InternLM/lmdeploy)). The implementation is under [nightly-benchmarks folder](.buildkite/nightly-benchmarks/) and you can [reproduce](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm/issues/8176) this benchmark using our one-click runnable script.

vLLM is flexible and easy to use with:

- Seamless integration with popular Hugging Face models
- High-throughput serving with various decoding algorithms, including *parallel sampling*, *beam search*, and more
- Tensor, pipeline, data and expert parallelism support for distributed inference
- Streaming outputs
- OpenAI-compatible API server
- Support NVIDIA GPUs, AMD CPUs and GPUs, Intel CPUs and GPUs, PowerPC CPUs, TPU, and AWS Neuron
- Prefix caching support
- Multi-LoRA support

vLLM seamlessly supports most popular open-source models on HuggingFace, including:
- Transformer-like LLMs (e.g., Llama)
- Mixture-of-Expert LLMs (e.g., Mixtral, Deepseek-V2 and V3)
- Embedding Models (e.g., E5-Mistral)
- Multi-modal LLMs (e.g., LLaVA)

Find the full list of supported models [here](https://docs.vllm.ai/en/latest/models/supported_models.html).
